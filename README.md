**#How to start a new angular app**
1. First you must have node installed (npm comes along with it) , check node installed by opening "node version" in cmd .
2. You also should have angular installed , check the "ng version" command to see if it is there .
3. Make a folder 
4. In this folder open cmd or vs code and write "ng new `app-name`"
5. write "ng-serve" to open the app on browser



# Angular-first-app
I made this app using angular documentation https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app 

Following features are there in the app:
1. It takes "house" data from an http server , then displays it on the "HOME PAGE" .
2. By clicking on different house tabs , new page opens showing details of the houses on the "DETAILS PAGE". 
3. There is a "SEARCH BOX" which helps filter out the houses and shows the houses .
4. Also there is a "FORM" where users can fill to apply living in the house .

Still Unclear :
1. *ngFOR working
2. Many many componenets , I am a bit confused 
* at least one revision is needed
